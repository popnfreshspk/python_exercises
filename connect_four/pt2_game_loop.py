# CONNECT 4 Part: 2
#
# Building on part 1, implement the game loop for Connect 4 using the ConnectFour
# class. 
#
# The Connect 4 class should use the objects you created (Board and Piece) as building
# blocks. By the end of this exercise running the play method on a ConnectFour object
# should allow you fill the connect four board with pieces, and recognize when the 
# board is full.
