# TIC-TAC-TOE Part 3:
# 
# The next task is to write a game loop to allow users to alternate 
# inputs to the tic-tac-toe board.
#
# Make sure the game alternates the game board turns, as well as makes sure
# users do not override other moves.

def insert_move():
	#
	# Your working code goes here
	#
	return 0

def print_board(game_board):
	#
	# Your working code goes here
	#
	return 0



# This is the primary game function, you will run the tic-tac-toe game using this
def tic_tac_toe():

	game_board = [
		[None, None, None],
		[None, None, None],
		[None, None, None]
	]

	# TODO: Write a game loop that takes in user input until the board
	# is full. Exit the loop once the board is full.
